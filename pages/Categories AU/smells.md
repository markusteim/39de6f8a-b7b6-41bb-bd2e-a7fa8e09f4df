# Summary

Overall **<Value data={polarity_proportions} column=percentage row=2/>%**  of students had a **positive experience**, in comparison to **<Value data={polarity_proportions} column=percentage row=0/>%** of students who had a **negative experience**.


**Negative** Student Experience Count: <Value data={polarity_proportions} column=category_count row=0/> 

**Neutral** Student Experience Count: <Value data={polarity_proportions} column=category_count row=1/>

**Positive** Student Experience Count: <Value data={polarity_proportions} column=category_count row=2/> 


In the realm of olfactory experiences at the university, the sentiment skews towards the negative, with more instances of unpleasant odors being reported than those of fresh and pleasant scents. The negative comments focus on the prevalence of smoke-related smells, which seem to be a common issue around campus areas, particularly near dorms and building entrances.

## Positive:
- Fresh Environment: The university offers a breath of fresh air, providing a sense of cleanliness and openness.


## Negative:
- Dorm Odors: A strong whiff of marijuana occasionally emanates from dorm rooms, causing discomfort to passersby.
- Entrance Smoke: Students smoking right next to building entrances create an unwelcoming atmosphere.
- Smoker Presence: The campus has a noticeable number of smokers, which can be irritating to non-smokers.
- Intermittent Smoking: Even occasional smoking by people around the campus is a source of annoyance.
