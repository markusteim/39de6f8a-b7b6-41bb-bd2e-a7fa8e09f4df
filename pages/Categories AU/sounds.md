# Summary
Overall **<Value data={polarity_proportions} column=percentage row=2/>%**  of students had a **positive experience**, in comparison to **<Value data={polarity_proportions} column=percentage row=0/>%** of students who had a **negative experience**.


**Negative** Student Experience Count: <Value data={polarity_proportions} column=category_count row=0/> 

**Neutral** Student Experience Count: <Value data={polarity_proportions} column=category_count row=1/>

**Positive** Student Experience Count: <Value data={polarity_proportions} column=category_count row=2/> 

The university's soundscape seems to be a mix of harmony and cacophony, with students experiencing both the vibrant local music scene and the disruptive noise from fire alarms and frat houses. The positive remarks are fewer, suggesting that while there are pockets of tranquility, particularly on the north side, the overall sentiment leans towards the challenges of dealing with unwanted noise.
