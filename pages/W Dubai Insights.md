    <b>Summary:</b>
    <br>
The hotel appears to be struggling with maintaining a consistent standard of aesthetics and functionality that aligns with its brand reputation. While some guests are impressed with the decor and unique style, others find the hotel's material aspects, such as accessories and equipment, to be subpar. The beach, a significant attraction for any hotel, is described as forgettable and not up to the hotel's standard. Additionally, the condition of the hotel's equipment and facilities suggests a lack of upkeep and modernization. The co-shared facilities with older hotels also detract from the guest experience. Despite some standout features like the pool area, the overall impression is that the hotel is not living up to the expectations set by its brand or by guest standards for luxury and uniqueness.

<b>List of issues from customer reviews:</b>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal; margin-left: 20px;">
<li>Substandard accessories and equipment (accessories are still far from the quality of the hotel and the
staff; age and condition of the equipment)</li>
<li>Poorly maintained grounds (grounds are unkept; it is in disrepair)</li>
<li>Inadequate beach quality (beach is forgettable; beach of the hotel unfortunately is far away from the
hotel standard; horrible view with beaches filled with tar and oils)</li>
<li>Insufficient restaurant size (breakfast restaurant is rather small in size)</li>
<li>Outdated co-shared facilities (co-shared facilities with 10+ year old hotels)</li>
<li>Lack of modern technology in rooms (rooms are very nice and spacious but are a technophobe&#39;s

<ol style="list-style-type: decimal; margin-left: 20px;">
<li>To improve the guest experience, the hotel should invest in upgrading its accessories and equipment
to match the quality expected of its brand.</li>
<li>The grounds need regular maintenance to ensure they are kept to a high standard.</li>
<li>The beach should be cleaned and maintained to become a highlight for guests rather than a
disappointment.</li>
<li>Expanding the size of the breakfast restaurant or optimizing the space to accommodate more guests
comfortably could alleviate concerns about its size.</li>
<li>Updating or renovating the co-shared facilities would help in providing a more modern and luxurious
experience. Integrating user-friendly technology in rooms can cater to all guests, including those who
are not tech-savvy.</li>
<li>Addressing the issue of unpleasant views, possibly with landscaping or design changes, could enhance
the overall ambiance.</li>

        The hotel is facing several issues related to comfort and cleanliness that are affecting guest satisfaction. The air
conditioning system appears to be inadequate, leading to uncomfortably hot rooms. Balcony doors are difficult
to operate due to their weight and faulty handles. The gym is outdated, and the pool area is too small for the
number of guests, leading to overcrowding. Housekeeping services are inconsistent, with reports of rooms not
being serviced and amenities not being replenished. The beach area is not exclusive to the hotel and is
crowded with children from neighboring hotels, which some guests found undesirable. Additionally, there are
concerns about the cleanliness of the beach and the quality of the water

<li>Clear communication regarding the all-inclusive package can be achieved through better staff training

<li>Improving service speed in restaurants and for room service may require additional staff or

        The feedback from guests indicates concerns regarding the location of the hotel, which seems to be situated in
an area with considerable partying and noise. This has caused discomfort for guests seeking a peaceful
environment, particularly for those traveling alone in a foreign country. Additionally, there appears to be an

        The guest reviews indicate that there are at least two distinct odor-related issues within the hotel. One review
suggests a problem with a sewer-like smell, which could point to issues with plumbing or waste management
systems. Another review complains about the smell of cigarettes or stale tobacco at the rooftop bar, which may
be due to inadequate ventilation or the absence of a designated smoking area. These concerns have been
raised in separate reviews, and while they do not suggest a widespread problem, they do highlight specific
areas where attention is needed

        <br>

    <b>List of issues from customer reviews:</b>
    <ol style="list-style-type: decimal; margin-left: 20px;">

    <li>Sewer-like smell in the hotel (smells like a sewer).</li>
<li>Unpleasant tobacco odor at the rooftop bar (rooftop bar that utterly stinks of cigarettes / stale
tobacco).</li>

    </ol>

<br>

<b>Suggestions:</b>
<br>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal; margin-left: 20px;">

    <li>For the sewer-like smell, it is recommended to conduct a thorough inspection of the hotel&#39;s plumbing
and waste management systems to identify and rectify the source of the odor. Regular maintenance
and checks could prevent such issues from arising in the future.</li>
<li>Regarding the tobacco smell at the rooftop bar, the hotel should consider improving ventilation in the
area and possibly introducing an air purification system. Additionally, creating a designated smoking
area away from the main bar space could help contain and reduce the spread of smoke-related odors.
Implementing a no-smoking policy or restricting smoking to certain hours may also be beneficial.
Regular cleaning and airing out of the space can further minimize the presence of stale odors</li>

  <AccordionItem title="Sound">
        <b>Summary:</b>
        <br>
        
        The hotel is experiencing significant noise issues that are affecting guest comfort and satisfaction. The primary
sources of disturbance are a construction site adjacent to the hotel, a nearby beach bar, and the hotel's own
bar and pool area. Guests report that the noise is persistent throughout the day and night, with loud music
from the bars and construction noise being particularly bothersome. The lack of soundproofing in rooms
exacerbates the problem, as guests can hear noise from adjoining rooms and external sources even with doors
and windows closed. This situation is detrimental to the hotel's reputation and could lead to a decline in repeat
business if not addressed.

2am, 3am at weekends,&quot; &quot;loud music until 3am&quot;).</li>

everything said from the adjacent rooms&quot;).</li>
<li>Noise from the hotel&#39;s own bar and pool area (e.g., &quot;loud music in every public space,&quot; &quot;some noise
with the partying going on in the pool area&quot;).</li>
<li>Disruption from street noise (e.g., &quot;constant honking of car horns from the street below,&quot; &quot;westin
beach was better, but there was constant helicopter noise throughout the day&quot;)</li>

The limited food selection extends beyond breakfast, with guests noting a lack of fine dining experiences and
limited food offerings at other meal times. Additionally, there are specific mentions of issues with room
service, such as unavailable items and standard of food provided. The ability of the bar staff to prepare certain
drinks has also been questioned. However, it is worth noting that there is a positive mention of the Ginger
