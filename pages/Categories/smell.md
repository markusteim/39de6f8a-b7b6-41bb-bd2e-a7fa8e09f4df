        <br>
        
        The feedback provided indicates that there is a specific issue with at least one of the
rooms that is connected to the kitchen. The guest has expressed dissatisfaction with
their experience, suggesting that the proximity to the kitchen may be causing
unpleasant smells to permeate into the room. This is an isolated comment and does
not necessarily reflect a widespread problem, but it does highlight a potential area for
improvement in guest experience related to odors in rooms adjacent to the kitchen.

        <br>
        <br>

    <b>List of issues from customer reviews:</b>
    <ol style="list-style-type: decimal; margin-left: 20px;">

    <li>Unpleasant odors in room connected to the kitchen ("if u consider staying in
the room that is connected with kitchen, be aware of this", "it was not pleasant
at all")</li>


    </ol>

<br>

<b>Suggestions:</b>
<br>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal; margin-left: 20px;">

    <li>To address the issue, the hotel management could consider improving
ventilation and exhaust systems in the kitchen to prevent odors from
spreading to adjacent rooms. Additionally, ensuring that doors between the
kitchen and connected rooms are properly sealed could help mitigate the
issue.</li>
<li>Regular checks and maintenance of these areas could prevent similar
complaints in the future. If the room&#39;s design allows, reassigning its purpose to
one that is not affected by kitchen smells, such as storage or staff space,
could also be a solution.</li>
