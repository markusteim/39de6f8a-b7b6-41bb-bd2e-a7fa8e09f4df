        <br>
        
        The feedback from guests indicates that there are several areas where the hotel's
service could be improved to make guests feel more welcome and valued. Issues
range from staff responsiveness to the efficiency of service delivery in the restaurant.
Some guests have experienced delays and a lack of attention, which has impacted
their perception of the hotel's commitment to guest satisfaction. Additionally, there
are concerns about billing accuracy and the handling of special requests, such as
early check-in. The presence of staff who appear disengaged and the inconsistent
offering of compensatory upgrades also contribute to guests' mixed feelings.

        <br>

    <b>List of issues from customer reviews:</b>
    <ol style="list-style-type: decimal; margin-left: 20px;">

    <li>Staff responsiveness and attentiveness (e.g., &quot;concierge was hesitant to
assist us,&quot; &quot;restaurant staff who need to be more attentive and helpful&quot;).</li>
<li>Service delays (e.g., &quot;it took us almost an hour to receive our starter&quot;).</li>
<li>Perceived unfair treatment (e.g., &quot;family came and they were served ahead of
us&quot;).</li>
<li>Inattentive and disengaged staff (e.g., &quot;person wearing a green jacket who
often seemed lost and distracted,&quot; &quot;lazy and ignored us when we didn&#39;t tip&quot;).</li>
<li>Inconsistency in service offerings (e.g., &quot;offering upgrades for next visits,&quot;
&quot;stop offering upgrades for next visits&quot;).</li>
<li>Communication issues (e.g., &quot;listens to respond and doesnâ€™t listen to
understand&quot;).</li>
<li>Failure to address problems (e.g., &quot;never actually doing anything to rectify the
issues&quot;).</li>
<li>Billing errors (e.g., &quot;double charged for our room,&quot; &quot;amount is still not in the
account&quot;).</li>
<li>Handling of special requests (e.g., &quot;changed the availability of early check in
to no longer available&quot;).</li>


    </ol>

<br>

<b>Suggestions:</b>
<br>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal; margin-left: 20px;">

    <li>To improve the guest experience, the hotel should focus on staff training to
ensure that all team members are proactive, attentive, and responsive to
guest needs.</li>
<li>Implementing a more rigorous service standard, particularly in the restaurant,
could help reduce wait times and ensure all guests are served promptly and
fairly.</li>
<li>Regular staff meetings to reinforce the importance of guest satisfaction and to
discuss feedback could also be beneficial. Additionally, the hotel should
review its billing processes to prevent errors and establish a clear policy on
upgrades and special requests to avoid confusion and inconsistency.</li>
<li>Finally, the hotel might consider a system to track and follow up on guest
issues to ensure they are resolved satisfactorily</li>
