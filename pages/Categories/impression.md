                       <b>Summary:</b>
        <br>
        
        The feedback from guests indicates a range of issues that affect their overall
impression of the hotel. Some guests have encountered problems with their rooms,
while others have expressed dissatisfaction with specific services or amenities.
Comparisons with other hotels suggest that guests have higher expectations based
on the price point and perceived value. There are also mentions of personal losses
on the property and during transportation, which may reflect on the security
measures or assistance provided by the hotel. The presence of both positive and
negative comments about staff and services suggests inconsistency in the guest
experience.

        <br>

    <b>List of issues from customer reviews:</b>
    <ol style="list-style-type: decimal; margin-left: 20px;">

    <li>Room issues (01st room had a few issues, issue in our room, minor flaws that
appear as quite unnecessary).</li>
<li>Comparatively lower value (atlantis the royal and park hyatt which are both 5
stars as well. but it&#39;s totally not comparable, both price are the same, around
$2000 but now i regretted).</li>
<li>Small drop-off area (drop off area is small, often crowded with cars).</li>
<li>Lack of 24-hour laundry service (only wish they have 24 hours laundry
service).</li>
<li>Inconvenient location for some guests (it&#39;s a long drive from al ain).</li>
<li>Negative experiences leading to loss of personal items (i dropped some
valuable items in a cab, one time i lost my precious pendant after breakfast,
we lost our wallet).</li>
<li>Inconsistency in service quality (unlike the other valets, these two guys
mastered this also, very good hotels provide also shadow housekeeping
service).</li>
<li>Language barrier in accessing reviews (trip advisor system is doubtful for
japanese customers because they cannot see japanese reviews unless they
change the language to japanese).</li>
<li>Negative overall experiences (i do not recommend this place, make the stay
there terrible, very bad, worst experiences).</li>


    </ol>

<br>

<b>Suggestions:</b>
<br>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal; margin-left: 20px;">

    <li>To address these issues, the hotel could conduct a thorough review of room
quality and address any recurring problems.</li>
<li>Improving the drop-off area to accommodate more vehicles could alleviate
congestion. Implementing a 24-hour laundry service would cater to guests&#39;
needs around the clock.</li>
<li>The hotel could also consider offering transportation services for guests who
find the location inconvenient.</li>
<li>Enhancing security measures and providing better support for lost items
would improve guest confidence.</li>
<li>Training staff to ensure consistent service quality across all roles is essential.</li>
<li>Finally, ensuring that the hotel&#39;s reviews are accessible in multiple languages
would help international guests make informed decisions.</li>

    <b>List of positive aspects from customer reviews:</b>
    <ol style="list-style-type: decimal; margin-left: 20px;">

<li>Room amenities and convenience for extended stays (e.g., &quot;able to make a
simple dinner in the kitchen in the room,&quot; &quot;all utensils were new,&quot; &quot;diswasher
and washing machine&quot;).</li>
<li>Location and accessibility (e.g., &quot;convenience store right in front of the hotel&quot;).</li>

<br>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal; margin-left: 20px;">

    <li>To further enhance the guest experience, the hotel could consider expanding
the use of its facilities by encouraging guests to try them out, perhaps through
promotional activities or guided tours. Additionally, ensuring that all staff
members are equally recognized and known by guests could further
personalize the service.</li>
<li>While the hotel is performing well, continuous monitoring of guest feedback
for any emerging issues or areas for improvement will help maintain high
standards of service.</li>
