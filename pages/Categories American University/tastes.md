The overall sentiment from the university reviews regarding tastes, food, dining, and restaurants seems to be a mix of satisfaction and dissatisfaction. While some students appreciate the variety and quality of food options available, particularly off-campus, others express disappointment with the on-campus dining experience, citing limited options, repetitive menus, and subpar quality. The positive remarks often highlight the diversity of international cuisine and the presence of popular chain restaurants, whereas the negative comments tend to focus on the lack of variety and the quality of food provided by the university's dining services.
