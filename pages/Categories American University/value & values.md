# Summary

Overall **<Value data={polarity_proportions} column=percentage row=2/>%**  of students had a **positive experience**, in comparison to **<Value data={polarity_proportions} column=percentage row=0/>%** of students who had a **negative experience**.


**Negative** Student Experience Count: <Value data={polarity_proportions} column=category_count row=0/> 

**Neutral** Student Experience Count: <Value data={polarity_proportions} column=category_count row=1/>

**Positive** Student Experience Count: <Value data={polarity_proportions} column=category_count row=2/> 

In the realm of non-material values and value for money at the university, the sentiment is mixed with a tilt towards the negative. Students appreciate the diversity, inclusivity, and academic strength, particularly in political science and international relations. However, there's a strong undercurrent of dissatisfaction regarding the high cost of attendance, perceived lack of support for non-political majors, and administrative issues. The university's liberal atmosphere is both a draw and a point of contention, depending on individual political leanings.
