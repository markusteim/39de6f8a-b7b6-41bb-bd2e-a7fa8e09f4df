## Positive:
- **Campus Safety:** Students feel secure with the presence of campus police, blue light emergency phones, and public safety officers patrolling after 9pm. Examples include the quick response to emergency calls and the visibility of security vehicles.
- **Neighborhood Security:** The university is situated in a safe and quiet neighborhood, contributing to students' comfort. The proximity to Homeland Security and low crime rates in the surrounding area are often mentioned.
- **Safety Measures:** The university's efforts in safety training, such as self-defense classes and preventative training, are appreciated. Additionally, the security system is described as top-notch, with locked closets in dorms and emergency systems installed across campus.
- **Night Safety:** Many students report feeling safe walking alone at night on campus, thanks to well-lit paths and constant patrols.
- **Security Alerts:** The university's communication regarding safety concerns, including text alerts and helicopter searches during emergencies, is seen as a positive aspect of campus security.

 

## Negative:
- **Off-Campus Concerns:** Students express unease once leaving campus, with some areas described as sketchy or tense, and advice against walking alone late at night.
- **Theft Issues:** There are reports of theft, particularly of unattended laptops, and recommendations to use U-locks for bikes and to lock dorm doors.
- **Substance Abuse:** While the drug scene is described as almost non-existent, there are warnings about obtaining drugs from trusted sources and the need to be cautious.
- **Safety Incidents:** A few students mention incidents such as armed non-students on campus and thefts, which have impacted their sense of security.
- **Party Safety:** Some students feel less safe at frat parties and advise against walking alone to and from such events.
