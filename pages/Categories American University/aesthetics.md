- **Dorm Quality**: Many find the dorms to be nice, especially the upperclassmen suites and newly renovated buildings, contrasting them favorably against typical freshman accommodations.
- **Natural Environment**: The presence of parks, an arboretum, and a variety of plants, including cherry blossoms, contributes to a vibrant and refreshing atmosphere that students cherish.
- **Architectural Appreciation**: The design and upkeep of new buildings, such as the School of International Service, receive accolades for their modernity and aesthetic appeal.

## Negative:
- **Facility Issues**: Some students express dissatisfaction with certain buildings and facilities, noting that they are outdated, under renovation, or have maintenance issues that are not promptly addressed.
- **Inconsistent Dorms**: While some dorms are praised, others are criticized for being old, unrenovated, or not as aesthetically pleasing as their counterparts.
- **Campus Size**: A common complaint is the small size of the campus, with some students wishing for more space or finding the compactness less than ideal.
