The general sentiment from the university reviews presents a mixed bag of experiences, with a notable number of students expressing both satisfaction and dissatisfaction. Positive comments often highlight the university's location, opportunities, and specific programs, while negative remarks tend to focus on issues with housing, dining, and a perceived lack of school spirit or community. The balance between positive and negative sentiments seems to lean slightly towards the positive, but the criticisms are significant and recurrent enough to suggest that the university experience is far from perfect for many students.
