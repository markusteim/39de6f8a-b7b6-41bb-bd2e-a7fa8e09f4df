The reviews present a mixed bag of sentiments regarding comfort and cleanliness at the university. While there are numerous positive remarks about spacious and clean dorms, well-kept facilities, and mild weather, there are also significant complaints about cramped rooms, pest issues, and unpredictable weather patterns. The positive experiences seem to slightly outweigh the negative ones, but the concerns raised are not trivial and point to areas needing improvement.

## Positive:

- Spacious Accommodations: Students appreciate the larger-than-average room sizes, with ample built-in storage and comfortable living spaces.
- Clean Facilities: Many reviews highlight the cleanliness of dorms, bathrooms, and public areas, noting daily cleaning routines.
- Climate Control: The ability to control room temperature with AC/heating units is praised, as well as the mildness of the DC weather compared to other regions.
- Well-Maintained Gyms: The new Cassell gym and other athletic facilities receive commendations for being in great condition and well-kept.
- Pleasant Environment: The campus is described as clean and well-maintained, contributing to a comfortable and enjoyable atmosphere for students.


## Negative:

- Cramped Quarters: Complaints about overcrowded rooms, especially when three people are squeezed into spaces meant for two, are common.
- Pest Problems: Several reviews mention issues with cockroaches, mice, and rats in dorms, which significantly detract from the living experience.
- Weather Woes: The unpredictability of DC weather, including humidity, rain, and temperature fluctuations, is a source of discomfort for some.
- Inadequate Facilities: Students note that some facilities, like the gym, are too small for the student body, and there are reports of malfunctioning appliances.
- Sanitation Concerns: Cleanliness is inconsistent, with some areas being well-maintained while others suffer from neglect, leading to unsanitary conditions.
