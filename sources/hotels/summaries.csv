The campus's compact nature and the availability of multiple fitness centers are highlighted as positives, contributing to a comfortable and convenient environment for students.

However, the reviews also reveal a troubling picture of mental health resources and services. Students report difficulties in accessing mental health professionals, describing the counseling center as inadequate and the mental health resources as poor. The presence of drug use on campus, including Adderall and cocaine, raises concerns about the overall safety and well-being of the student body.

The campus's small size is also appreciated for its walkability and the sense of community it fosters.

The soundscape of the university is a tale of two campuses, with a clear dichotomy between the tranquil Northside and the raucous Southside. Students' experiences with noise are predominantly negative, with numerous complaints about the auditory intrusions disrupting their peace. The dormitories are notorious for their paper-thin walls, which act as mere veils to the cacophony of neighbors' conversations, music, and nocturnal activities. Fire alarms are a particularly vexing issue, with their frequent, unwarranted blaring becoming a disruptive motif in the students' chorus of grievances. The Southside is especially infamous for its higher volume of disturbances, from louder social activities to more frequent thefts and fire drills.

On the flip side, the Northside is lauded for its serenity, offering a quieter reputation that is cherished by those seeking refuge from the clamor. Some students find solace in specific areas like Mary Graydon, which maintains a balance between morning quietude and vibrant afternoons. The local music scene also strikes a positive note, providing a cultural respite from the otherwise dissonant soundscape.

The university does attempt to mediate the noise levels, with dedicated quiet floors and enforced quiet hours, though some students feel the enforcement is too lenient, allowing noisy neighbors and inebriated revelers to escape consequences. The contrast in experiences is stark, with the entire arena of screaming fans at events juxtaposed against the desire for a hushed environment in living spaces.

In essence, the overall sentiment skews negative due to the pervasive issue of noise, with the positive aspects like the local music scene and quieter Northside areas being overshadowed by the relentless auditory onslaught that plagues much of the student body.",summary category 8,,,,,
338,10,American University,"In the realm of university dining experiences, the sentiment skews towards the negative, with a substantial number of students expressing dissatisfaction with on-campus food options. The high tuition costs have set expectations for a diverse and high-quality meal selection, which many feel are unmet, leading to disappointment. Complaints range from the monotony of the dining hall offerings, which are often described as repetitive and sometimes barely edible, to the limited variety and poor quality of food, including instances of undercooked chicken and moldy bread. The meal plan also comes under fire for being difficult to use up, suggesting that the value for money is lacking.

However, it's not all bleak on the culinary front. A number of positive reviews highlight the availability of international cuisine and a decent variety of restaurants, particularly off-campus. Washington D.C.'s vibrant food scene offers a respite from the campus dining, with students enjoying a range of eateries from Panera and Chipotle to local favorites like Guapo's and Cava. The area's international food options and world-renowned restaurants receive praise, and there are mentions of specific spots like Z Burger and Neisha Thai that are student favorites. The dining hall does have its good days, with some students satisfied with the variety and tastes of the food on offer.

In summary, while on-campus dining receives considerable criticism for its lack of diversity, quality, and value, the surrounding city's dining scene provides a plethora of options that students appreciate. The overall sentiment leans negative due to the significant emphasis on the subpar campus food experience, but the redeeming factor lies in the rich tapestry of off-campus dining that Washington D.C. has to offer.",summary category 9,,,,,
339,10,American University,"The overall sentiment from the university reviews presents a mixed picture of student experiences, with a notable lean towards positive feedback regarding the campus facilities, particularly the dormitories and weather conditions. 

In terms of comfort and cleanliness, students generally appreciate the dormitories, describing them as clean, spacious, and well-equipped with storage space. The gym, although small, is also seen as a positive feature. However, there are notable grievances about the dorm living conditions, with complaints about the inability to control room temperature, lack of soundproofing, and issues with overcrowding, particularly in rooms where three people are squeezed into spaces designed for two. Some dorms are also criticized for pest problems, such as cockroaches and mice, and the occasional presence of mold.

The weather in D.C. is a topic of mixed reviews. While some students find the mild winters and warmer fall and winter seasons compared to the Northeast to be a positive aspect, others struggle with the unpredictable weather patterns, including sudden temperature changes and uncomfortable humidity in the summer. The weather seems to have a minimal impact on the campus experience for some, while for others, it can be a significant discomfort.

Off-campus housing receives a generally positive response, with students finding it nice and convenient. However, there are concerns about the limited options and the potential for choosing an apartment with issues such as poor appliance functionality and pest infestations.

The overall sentiment regarding visibility at the university leans towards the negative, with several students expressing dissatisfaction about the lighting conditions, particularly in the housing and bathroom areas. Complaints about the darkness in bathrooms are recurrent, with students specifically pointing out that both the general bathroom areas and the showers would greatly benefit from better lighting. The issue of insufficient light seems to be a common theme, with some areas of the campus being described as needing better illumination.

On the flip side, when it comes to natural light, the university receives praise. Students appreciate the large windows and the substantial amount of natural light that permeates through various spaces. This aspect of the university's design is repeatedly mentioned as a ""huge plus,"" suggesting that where architectural considerations have been made for natural lighting, the results are highly valued by the student body.

However, the positive remarks about natural light are somewhat tempered by the mention of the campus being ""pretty cloudy,"" which could imply that while the potential for natural light is there, environmental factors may not always allow for it to be enjoyed to its fullest extent.

In summary, while the university has made commendable efforts to incorporate natural light into its design, which students recognize and appreciate, there is a clear call for improvements in artificial lighting, especially in essential areas like bathrooms. The prevalence of negative experiences in this regard suggests that the issue is significant enough to warrant attention and action from the university administration.",summary category 11,,,,,

The overall sentiment regarding the olfactory experiences at the university leans towards the negative, with several complaints highlighting issues related to smoking. While there is a mention of the campus providing a sense of fresh air, this positive aspect is overshadowed by the prevalence of smoke-related grievances.

The singular positive note comes from a student who appreciates the fresh air that the university environment offers. This suggests that there are areas within the campus that maintain a clean and refreshing atmosphere, providing a pleasant experience for those who frequent them.

However, the negative comments are more numerous and specific, painting a picture of a campus where the smell of smoke is a common concern. Students report an unpleasant experience when encountering the strong odor of marijuana emanating from dorm rooms. This indicates that the issue is not isolated to outdoor areas but also affects the living spaces, potentially impacting the comfort and well-being of residents.

Furthermore, the problem of smoking is not limited to the occasional whiff of marijuana. Students express frustration over their peers smoking right next to building entrances, which can be particularly bothersome for non-smokers or those sensitive to smoke. The presence of many smokers on campus is described as ""obnoxious,"" suggesting that this is a widespread and intrusive issue.

The mention of ""people smoking occasionally"" might seem to downplay the situation, but it still contributes to the overall negative perception of the university's atmosphere regarding smell. The fact that smoking is noted in various contexts—near dorms, building entrances, and as a general presence—indicates that the issue is both prevalent and pervasive, affecting multiple areas of campus life.

In summary, while there is an appreciation for the pockets of fresh air at the university, the dominant narrative is one of dissatisfaction with the smoking habits on campus, which significantly detract from the overall student experience in terms of smell.",summary category 12,,,,,

The architecture is noted for its classic style, and the presence of new, environmentally friendly buildings adds to the appeal. The campus's location strikes a balance between suburban tranquility and city life, with easy access to cultural attractions and the heart of the city.

Dorms and housing options receive mixed reviews, but the positive comments dominate. Many students are satisfied with their living arrangements, highlighting nice dorms, suite-style accommodations, and recently renovated buildings. Upperclassmen seem to have access to better housing options, and the presence of nearby apartments offers additional choices. However, there are some criticisms about the older, unrenovated dorms and the occasional maintenance issues that arise.

The university's efforts to expand and improve facilities are noted and appreciated, with mentions of green roofs and new construction projects. The campus is also recognized for its status as an arboretum, which contributes to its overall charm and the enjoyment of the changing seasons.

Negative comments are relatively few and tend to focus on specific aspects such as the less attractive freshman dorms, the need for more renovations, and the inconvenience caused by ongoing construction. Some students also mention the lack of diversity in the student body's appearance and the prevalence of a preppy style.

In summary, students generally find the university's campus aesthetically pleasing, with a few areas in need of improvement. The positive experiences with the campus's beauty and the quality of housing options for upperclassmen overshadow the less favorable views on certain dorms and the temporary disruptions due to renovations.",summary category 13,,,,,

The university's commitment to diversity, sustainability, and social justice also garners commendation, as does the inclusivity towards LGBTQ+ students and the richness of cultural events.

However, the university's atmosphere is not without its shadows. A significant number of students express discontent with the high cost of attendance, describing the tuition as ""highway robbery"" and lamenting the financial strain it imposes. The administration's perceived focus on profit over student welfare and the bureaucratic hurdles in obtaining financial aid or resolving issues add to the frustration. Additionally, the lack of school spirit, particularly in relation to sports, and the sense of a divided community are recurrent themes in the negative feedback.

The student body's political leanings and the university's emphasis on politics are double-edged swords; while some thrive in this environment, others feel alienated or overwhelmed by the pervasive political discourse. The social scene is marked by a contrast between active Greek life and a noted absence of traditional college experiences like football games.

In summary, American University is academically robust and socially progressive, set in a politically charged environment that offers a wealth of professional opportunities. Yet, the high cost and certain aspects of campus life leave a portion of the student body questioning the value for money and yearning for a more cohesive community spirit.",summary category 14,,,,,
